# Calculating the Biodiversity Intactness Index: the PREDICTS implementation

The document gives an example of how to model and project the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) using a subset of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) database and highlights some of the advantages, extensions, assumptions and limitations of the approaches used.

This is the second version of the walkthrough. The main update has been to use a more sensitive measure of compositional similarity, which accounts for changes in community structure rather than just species identity.
